# AMT_PowerTool4

# Powertool 4.MQ4

This is first artifact, prior to adding CSVPositions.CSV.

This version is a complete version for application on VPS. The version covers:

* Entry
* Exit
* Position pyramiding
* Position sizing

* Long term - Leg of the Year
* Medium term - part of leg of the Year

For successor version, I am adding persistent positions parameter keeper, **SO THAT**, in the event of VPS dropped and restarted, parameters of each position are intact. In the event of restarted, all positions retain its latest parameters as saved in every parameter's update. **At least**, but not limited to, 

If something not working well in the new version, using this saved-version on the GitHub, I can revert back to the last working version.
